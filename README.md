# React Playground

React component for creating interactive coding playgrounds with examples.

----

Based on [@gcanti](https://github.com/gcanti)'s playground pages for
[tcomb-forms](http://gcanti.github.io/resources/tcomb-form/playground/playground.html) and
[tcomb-validation](https://gcanti.github.io/resources/tcomb-validation/playground/playground.html) -
this aims to be a reusable means of generating similar interactive example pages.
